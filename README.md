# Follow Twitter Card

The Follow Card project is a small example of a Twitter-like following card implemented in React using the useState hook. It simulates a card displaying user information and a follow button. When the user clicks the follow button, it toggles the follow status, updating the UI accordingly. This project serves as a practical demonstration of managing state in React components with the useState hook, as well as a simple UI component implementation.
